# ATS Resume Shortlisting System

This project implements a Job Role–Based Applicant Tracking System (ATS) using Python and Streamlit.  
The system automatically screens multiple resumes, matches them with job-specific IT and soft skills from an Excel dataset, and ranks candidates based on relevance.

Only the Top 10 resumes are shortlisted and displayed with individual accuracy percentages and visualization.
